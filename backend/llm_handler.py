USE CASE:
This script will be used as the narration for an educational animation. The script needs to align perfectly with a visual animation that will be generated to accompany it. Your script will guide the development of the animation and serve as the voiceover that explains the concepts as they appear visually.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Write a COMPLETE, PROFESSIONAL narration script
2. Structure the script in clear sections (Introduction, Main Concepts, Conclusion)
3. Include timestamps or markers for key transition points
4. Write in a conversational, engaging tone appropriate for educational content
5. Explain complex concepts clearly with appropriate analogies
6. Include pauses for viewers to process visual information
7. Keep sentences concise for easier narration
8. Use a logical progression that builds understanding step-by-step
9. Include questions or points of reflection to engage viewers
10. End with a clear summary of key takeaways
11. IMPORTANT: Be COMPREHENSIVE and THOROUGH in your explanations - include all necessary details
12. Don't rush or abbreviate explanations - take the time needed to properly explain the concept
